In order to set up the file for this system, user must remember the order of sensors that must follow the correct position in the door :
	-INPUT PIN 5 : SENSOR ON THE LEFT OF THE DOOR ( SENSOR 1 IN THE DIAGRAM ).
	-INPUT PIN 6 : SENSOR ON THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR ( SENSOR 2 IN THE DIAGRAM ).
	-INPUT PIN 7 : FIRST SENSOR ABOVE THE DOOR ( SENSOR 3 IN THE DIAGRAM ), ( which can detec your actual heght ).
	-INPUT PIN 8 : SECOND SENSOR ABOVE THE DOOR ( SENSOR 4 IN THE DIAGRAM ), ( which a bit higher than sensor 3 ).

Remember to note down the position of the plug in on the breadboard when using it for multiple sensor.

Prepare the long-enough cable to connect the sensors ( which plug around the door ) and the breadboard ( which is set up in a place near the computer to collect data ).
